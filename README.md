## Project Overview

The Employee Management System aims to provide an efficient solution for storing and managing employee data within an organization. It allows for the creation of employee profiles, assignment to departments, tracking of salaries and titles, and more. The system offers various functionalities such as querying employee information, generating reports, and analyzing the data for decision-making purposes.

The project consists of the following database tables:

- `employees`: Stores employee details including employee number, name, birth date, sex, hire date, and job title.
- `Departments`: Contains information about the different departments within the organization such as department number and name.
- `dept_employees`: Represents the relationship between employees and departments, indicating which employees belong to which departments.
- `managers`: Stores information about managers, including the employee number and the department they manage.
- `salaries`: Tracks the salary history of employees, including the employee number and the corresponding salary amount.
- `title`: Stores the different job titles available within the organization.

## Data Analysis

The Employee Management System provides valuable data for analysis within the organization. Here are a few potential analysis scenarios that can be performed on the project data:

1. **Employee Demographics**: The system allows for analyzing the distribution of employees based on their demographic information such as gender, age, and hire date. This analysis can provide insights into workforce diversity and hiring trends over time.

2. **Department Performance**: By analyzing the performance metrics of different departments, such as the number of employees, average salary, or employee turnover rate, it becomes possible to identify the departments that are performing well and those that may require attention or improvement.

3. **Salary Analysis**: The salary data stored in the system enables the analysis of employee compensation. It allows for calculating average salaries by department, identifying salary disparities, or tracking salary trends over time. This analysis can help ensure fair compensation practices and identify areas for salary adjustments.

4. **Employee Retention**: By analyzing employee hire dates, job titles, and turnover rates, it becomes possible to identify patterns related to employee retention. This analysis can help in developing strategies to improve employee satisfaction and retention within the organization.

These are just a few examples of the potential data analysis that can be performed using the Employee Management System. The system provides a foundation for further exploration and understanding of employee-related information to support decision-making processes within the organization.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Employee Management System, follow these steps:

1. **Database Setup**: Set up a PostgreSQL database and create the necessary tables as described in the project documentation.

2. **Data Import**: Import the provided CSV files into the respective tables using the appropriate SQL commands or tools such as PGAdmin.

3. **Data Validation**: Ensure that the imported data is accurate and complete. Perform any necessary data cleansing or validation steps to ensure data integrity.

4. **Connectivity**: Establish a connection to the database using your preferred SQL client or interface.

5. **Data Analysis**: Utilize SQL queries to perform various analyses on the employee data, as described in the project documentation.

## Usage

The Employee Management System provides a range of functionalities for managing and analyzing employee data. Here are some example use cases:

- Retrieve employee information, including employee numbers, names, departments, salaries, and titles.
- Generate reports on employee demographics, department performance, or salary analysis.
- Perform data analysis to identify trends, patterns, or outliers in the employee data.
- Update employee records to reflect changes in department assignments or job titles.
- Query and filter employee data based on specific criteria such as hire date, gender, or salary range.

To perform any of these tasks, execute SQL queries against the database tables using a SQL client or interface.
